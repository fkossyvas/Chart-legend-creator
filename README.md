## Chart legend creator

I needed to create the legend for a chart, so i created one using Paint.net, as asked from an end user.
After too many changes asked by the end user (colors,size, levels,names, etc. ğŸ˜“) i decided to create this app so that i could modify the legend more easily ğŸ˜‰

After editing the legend, you can right click on it and save it as an image.
